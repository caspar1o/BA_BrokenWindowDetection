# BA_map_yolo_leaflet

This is a tool for broken window object detection based on data from mapillary. Upon startup you can select an area inside a leaflet, the coordinates will be sent to the Mapillary-API and all images inside the area will be downloaded and processed using YOLOv8. As an output you are supposed to get markers with popup-information.
